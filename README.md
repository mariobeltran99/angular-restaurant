# Week 5

## Hamburgers üçî

It consists of an application for creating hamburgers, you can also edit and delete our hamburger.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.4.

## Prerequisites üìã

_In order to use the application and modify the code, it is necessary to have the following tools installed:_

- [NodeJS v15.11, NPM 7.x.x - Windows](https://nodejs.org/es/download/)
- [NVM v15.11, NPM 7.x.x - Linux](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [Angular v12.2.4](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)
- [Json-Server v0.17.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server)

## Installation Guide üñ•Ô∏è

_Make sure you have the requested prerequisites installed._

Run the command to install Angular CLI.

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Run the command to install json-server.

```bash
npm install -g json-server
```

Run the command to clone the project.

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/mariobeltran99/excercisesweek5
```

Run the command to install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Run the command to execute app

```bash
ng serve
```

And that's all for it to work

## Development server :wrench:

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## How to use json server :card_file_box:

- First copy and paste the hamburger.json file outside the project directory to avoid fast reload of angular.
- Second, go to the directory where I paste the file and execute the following command in your terminal to start the fake API service.

```bash
json-server hamburger.json
```

And we already have our API ready to be consumed by the client.
